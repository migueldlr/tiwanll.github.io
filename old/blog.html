				  Today I finished my PHP background selector, which is now in my portfolio. I began work on my PHP dice 
				  roller, which I have finished the basics of. I hope to add a chart that can scale itself based on the 
				  data given, as well as the capability to switch between viewing the raw data and the chart. Hopefully, 
				  I can come up with other ways to improve the tool. I also spent some time helping people with their own PHP.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">July 9, 2014</h3>
				<p class="entry">
				  Today I continued to work on my PHP calendar, which I have finished and put on my portfolio page. I also 
				  began and finished Dane Joe, which was less challenging especially now that I feel more comfortable putting 
				  PHP and HTML together. I have begun work on a background selector, which I believe I can finish soon. I 
				  was also able to help a few people with their own calendars and other various PHP projects.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">July 8, 2014</h3>
				<p class="entry">
				  Today Joel taught us basic PHP, which we used to create a random hexadecimal color code generator. We also 
				  began working on our PHP projects. I chose to work on the calendar, which is proving to be quite difficult 
				  due to issues with PHP and the input itself. Hopefully I can find an alternative, if not a solution. I also 
				  spent today helping other people with Subversion, HTML, and their own PHP projects.
				</p>

				  Today begins the second block, and my first day at Shodor since April. I was very excited to come back and 
				  continue to learn all sorts of things. Today we discussed Subversion, which is what we'll use to keep track 
				  of changes and revisions in our upcoming projects. We discussed some command line and vim topics alongside 
				  Subversion, as it is run in command line. I look forward to the rest of the week, and the weeks to come.

			      Today we continued our programming projects. I added a great deal of functionality to our model, giving the 
			  	  user the ability to resize the forest, change the forest to a grid, and displaying the burn radius circle 
			  	  on the cursor. I also helped make the graphics for the trees using GIMP. I've definitely learned a lot 
			  	  from this project, and I am definitely looking forward to presenting our project on the 12th.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">March 29, 2014</h3>
				<p class="entry">
			  	  Today we began our programming projects, which will be written in Javascript. We will be modeling the spread of 
			  	  a forest fire based on a number of variables, including the number of trees, arrangement of trees, spread 
			  	  probability of the fire, etc. This will be completed and presented on the 12th, and hopefully by then 
			  	  our model will be functional and understandable. I hope to learn much from this project.
				</p>

				<p class="entry">
			  	  Today we continued discussion of parallel thinking and computing. We learned how to boot BCCD on the machines, 
			  	  as well as how to write algorithms for parallelization of tasks. Aaron and Phil taught the lessons on coding 
			  	  in C, which we then compiled and ran in the terminal. Vikram and Elise, two Shodor interns, taught us about 
			  	  more parallel computing concepts including data vs task parallelization and diminishing returns.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">March 8, 2014</h3>
				<p class="entry">
				  Today we discussed a multitude of topics. Aaron and Patricia covered parallel computing in BCCD, which we used 
				  to compile and run code, as well as discuss parallel thinking. Mobeen taught the class about computer hardware, 
				  and led an activity on finding a computer build under a certain price value, which I found quite interesting. 
				  Phil helped the class with parallel computing, and Iain taught us about Conway's Game of Life, which is quite 
				  interesting on BCCD.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">March 1, 2014</h3>
				<p class="entry">
				  Today we discussed parallel computing using bootable cluster CDs. We familiarized ourselves with the Linux 
				  terminal, and used it to run different simulations, including one that modeled a pandemic and another modeling 
				  the formation of a galaxy. We also covered the pros and cons of using multiple processors and shared vs. 
				  distributed memory, which I found very interesting.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">February 1, 2014</h3>
				<p class="entry">
				  Today we presented our modeling projects to the class. I am confident we did well with ours, as we were able to 
				  explain our model well and answer all related questions. I was also happy to see the other models 
				  that had been made. After our presentations, we covered basic programming techniques with Safari's Javascript 
				  console. Hopefully, we will be able to further explore programming concepts.

				  Today is the last Shodor session before we have to present our projects on February the 1st. Our project is done, 
				  and I do not think we will have to continue work on our optional workday. I am eager to present, and 
				  I am looking forward to seeing the projects of other groups. I also worked on my HTML project and helped others with theirs, 
				  though I ended up not changing much on my website.
				</p>
				<h3 class="date-subheader">December 7, 2013</h3>
				<p class="entry">
				  Today we began work on our modeling projects. I worked with my partner Luis, and with hard work we finished our model 
				  even with many problems concerning the size of our model. We collected data for our project as well, and will use this data 
				  for our presentation. We will continue working on our project next week, and I look forward to our presentation.
				</p>

				  Today we watched Ron's presentation on Business Ethics. We were assigned a Business Ethics assignment alongside 
				  our HTML and modeling projects. Joel taught as well, covering how to connect to Shodor servers from other computers. 
				  I also worked on my HTML project, reorganizing files and changing layouts. I am looking forward to the modeling project, 
				  on which we will begin working on the 7th and 14th of December.

				  Today we began learning modeling in both Vensim and AgentSheets. Having been part of SSP, I have already been exposed 
				  to these techniques; however, I do think it was good practice for a topic I learned almost a year ago. Using the modeling 
				  software, we modeled hunger and the factors influencing it, as well as disease and how it spreads. I also worked on my HTML 
				  project and I am looking forward to working on our modeling projects, in which the skills we learned today to make our own models 
				  and present them.
