	<h1>About</h1>
	<p class="about">
	  Reader is a tool written in Javascript to help speed-read large passages of text by eliminating eye movement. A words per minute (wpm) 
	  value is entered, and the user is able to read the passage as the words appear on screen. The user may also stop 
	  and restart as necessary. The paragraph that is initially hidden can be shown with the 'Show Paragraph' button. The user may also 
	  input their own text file to read using the file input.

	  Excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">Wikipedia</a>.<br />
	  Inspired by the technology of <a href="http://www.spritzinc.com/">Spritz</a>. They actually have research on this, so check them out.<br />
	  Made by Miguel de los Reyes. Much gratitude to the staff of Shodor.
