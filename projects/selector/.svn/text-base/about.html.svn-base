	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	  Background Color Selector is a tool written in PHP and HTML that allows the user to choose their desired 
	  background color of the page from a dropdown menu. Due to Miguel's lack of imagination, only a few colors 
	  are provided. The page reloads when the user changes their selection. Cookies of the user's choice are 
	  stored for five minutes.
