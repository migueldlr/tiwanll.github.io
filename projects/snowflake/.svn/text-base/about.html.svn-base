	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	   Snowflake is a tool written in JavaScript that shows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch Snowflake</a> based on the 
	   number of iterations the user inputs. The site uses recursion to generate lines in the HTML canvas. The number of iterations ranges between 0 and 
	   8 inclusively, and it is not advised that the user input a number higher than 8. The user can also resize the canvas to in turn resize the snowflake 
	   by clicking and dragging.
