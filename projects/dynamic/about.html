	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	  Dynamic Story is a tool modeled after the popular Mad Libs, allowing the user to enter words to create a story. 
	  Dynamic Story uses PHP, focusing on using '$_GET' to capture input. Regular expressions were used to differentiate 
	  'a' from 'an' and make the PHP code more readable. Some HTML and CSS is used, obviously.
