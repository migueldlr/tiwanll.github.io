	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	  Dice is a tool for looking at multiple rolls of multiple dice. The user inputs the number of dice 
	  and the number of times to roll, and a table with the rolls as well as a chart tracking frequencies 
	  of the sums of rolls is generated. Let it be noted that values for dice or rolls that are too high may 
	  cause the page to freeze or mess up formatting. Dice was written with a heap of PHP, a dash of HTML, and a sprinkle of CSS.
