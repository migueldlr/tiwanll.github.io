		<h1>Circles</h1>
		<p>Circles was written after some fiddling done in JavaScript and the HTML canvas. Initially a generator for a circle under the mouse 
		cursor, it was quickly discovered that the code could be altered to display multiple circles at once. Random sizes and 
		colors were later added. As you may notice, these circles will randomize when clicked. Due to the nature of the algorithm, 
		there is always a circle under the mouse cursor when clicked.</p>
		<p>On the main page, the circles function similarly, though they automatically randomize when the browser window size is 
		changed.</p>
		<p>I apologize if you lose your favorite circle.</p>
