	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	  Dane Joe is a tool for switching the first letters and last letters of the first and last names of people written 
	  using PHP and some HTML and CSS. For example, Jane Doe becomes "Dane Joe". The tool also automatically 
	  makes the first letter capitalized and the rest lowercase.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Made by Miguel de los Reyes, whose name sadly does not capitalize correctly in his own code. Much gratitude to the staff of Shodor.
