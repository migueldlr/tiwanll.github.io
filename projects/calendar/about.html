	<h1 id='title'>About</h1>
	<p>This site uses PHP and HTML to create a calendar that displays the days in the month based on 
	the starting day of the week.</p>
	<p>The user inputs both using dropdown menus and when the 'Submit' button is clicked, the calendar 
	reloads based on the input. Cookies are stored for the input, and expire after fifteen minutes. 
	The boxes change color on hover, and the days of the week change color when their name is 
	highlighted. By default, the calendar displays the current month. Sadly, February only displays 29 days
	when the current year is a leap year.</p>
