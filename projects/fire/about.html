		A 2-D model of  a forest fire containing an array of trees. There are 
		two types of arrays, grid and random. The grid array arranges the trees
		by rows and columns. The random array disperses the trees all over the 
		canvas.
	</p>
	<p>
		The different parameters for this model include burn rate, burn radius,
		number of trees, number of rows, and number of columns.	The number of 
		trees option will only be available if the random array is selected. The
		number of rows and columns options will only be available if the grid 
		array is selected.			
	</p>
	<p>
		The simulation is initialized by a mouse click anywhere on the canvas.
		The trees catch fire based on the burn rate, which is the percent chance
		that a tree within a certain distance to the fire will also catch fire,
		and the burn radius, which is the distance in which a tree could catch 
		fire.
	</p>
	<p>
		During each time step that a tree is on fire, the image changes to show 
		that more fire is added. After 3 time steps, the tree dies and turns into
		a black dead tree.
