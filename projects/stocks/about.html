	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	  Stocks is a tool written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using AJAX to access data about stock prices and display it in a table. The user can 
	  enter more stock symbols to display. The site does not store these from session to session. The table is updated every five seconds, with the current 
	  date and time displayed at the top.

	  Made by Miguel de los Reyes. Much gratitude to the staff of Shodor.
